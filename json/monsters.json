It is covered with a heavy exoskeleton resembling the rocks of its mountain habitat, allowing it to blend in perfectly with its surroundings. It also has the ability to change the color of its exoskeleton to shades of white, allowing it to blend in with snowy environments as well. Its exoskeleton provides the dokufu with ample protection against physical harm, as well as magical harm as the chitin thickens with age.",
					"It is unknown how long dokufu live, but they can most certainly become several thousand years old. They mature and grow very slowly, but grow immensely in size the older they get. While a dokufu spiderling is no bigger than a small dog, they are about the size of a panther by the time they become younglings. Once they reach adulthood, they’re about as large as a horse, and truly ancient dokufu will grow to be the size of a mammoth.",
					"Feared and Avoided. If it is discovered that an area is home to a young dokufu, a hunting party is quickly gathered to kill the creature before it matures. Areas that contain mature dokufu are usually avoided completely, as many a great warrior has faced off against a dokufu, only to become fodder for its young. They are greatly feared throughout the Orient, and even speaking their name inspires terror in children and adults alike.",
					"Masters of Illusions. While they might resemble brutish creatures, dokufu are cunning and wise. They have the innate ability to create powerful illusions, which they typically utilize to lure prey closer. Their magical prowess becomes more powerful as they mature. Once old enough, they can even use the snow or stone beneath their feet as others would use a door, seemingly teleporting through the ground.",
					"Tainted Nature. Their eyes act as lenses, greatly increasing the potential of their illusory magics. This odd mutation is caused by the massive amount of Taint within the creature, which has rendered their eyes useless for seeing but granted it an otherworldly sense for perceiving its surroundings. This fact isn’t widely known, however, and more than one wu jen has attempted to blind a dokufu adversary only to discover that it wasn’t hindered by it in the least.",
					"Dark Reproduction. Dokufu are androgynous. They reproduce by implanting eggs into humanoid bodies to provide food for their young. Deep within caves, they hang the hosts from the ceiling, often while still alive. Shortly before the egg hatches inside the host, the adult dokufu will swallow the host, so the egg can hatch inside its digestive tract."
